# Kaggle-house-price

This is a entered competition of kaggle machine learning competition.

Competitor need to predict the house price according to some features about the houses.


Because there are lots of missing data, so I try to find the relation between features so that I can predicts them instead of delete them.

The score is not high. But it is a good start.
