# Kaggle-house-price

This is a entered competition of kaggle machine learning competition.

Competitor need to predict the house price according to some features about the houses.


Because there are lots of missing data, so I try to find the relation between features so that I can predicts them instead of delete them.

Then I use gradient boosting regression, random forest and svm to predict the price. Maybe next time I can try the lightGBM and Xgboost.

The score is not high. But it is a good start.
